## AI-Generated Code Warning

**THIS PROJECT IS 100% AI-GENERATED ("VIBE CODED")**

### What This Means

- ❌ **ZERO human-written code** — Every line was written by AI assistants (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- ❌ **NO manual coding** — All changes, features, and security implementations were AI-generated
- ❌ **NO professional review** — No human developer verified this code
- ❌ **NO security audit** — Security claims are theoretical, unverified, and AI-designed
- ❌ **Experimental nature** — This is a demonstration of AI-assisted software development

### Why This Matters

1. **Code Quality:** AI can make mistakes, introduce bugs, or create security vulnerabilities
2. **Understanding:** The maintainer may not fully understand every line of code
3. **Maintenance:** Future updates and bug fixes will also be AI-dependent
4. **Trust:** You should **review and understand** the code before deploying it

### What You Should Do

✅ **DO:**
- Review the source code before using
- Test thoroughly in a safe environment
- Understand the security model
- Report bugs and vulnerabilities
- Use in personal/experimental projects

❌ **DON'T:**
- Deploy directly to production without review
- Trust security claims without verification
- Use for critical/sensitive applications without audit
- Assume the code is bug-free

### Legal & Liability Waiver

**The maintainer (@noambars121) accepts ZERO liability for:**

- ❌ Security vulnerabilities or breaches
- ❌ Data loss, corruption, or leakage  
- ❌ Privacy violations
- ❌ Financial losses
- ❌ Legal issues or regulatory violations
- ❌ System damage or downtime
- ❌ ANY damages of any kind

**MIT License Terms:**
- **No Warranty:** This software is provided "as is" 
- **No Liability:** The maintainer is not responsible for any damages or issues
- **Use at Your Own Risk:** You accept FULL responsibility for all consequences

See [LEGAL-DISCLAIMER.md](LEGAL-DISCLAIMER.md) for complete legal terms.

### Based on Trusted Foundation

**Important:** The core architecture is based on [Moltbot](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot) by Peter Steinberger, which is a mature, battle-tested project. The AI modifications are on top of this solid foundation.

- **Original code:** Written by experienced developers ✅
- **AI additions:** Security hardening, branding changes ⚠️

**By using ClancyBot, you acknowledge:**
1. ✅ You understand this is AI-generated code
2. ✅ You accept ALL risks involved
3. ✅ You will review and test before production use
4. ✅ You won't hold the maintainer liable for ANY issues
