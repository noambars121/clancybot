## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Do NOT Report Here If:

- ❌ The vulnerability is in **Moltbot** (upstream) → Report to [Moltbot](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot)
- ❌ The vulnerability is in a **dependency** → Report to the dependency's maintainers

### Report to ClancyBot If:

- ✅ The vulnerability is specific to ClancyBot's security additions
- ✅ The vulnerability was introduced by AI-generated modifications

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. Contact via GitHub Security Advisory or email (see profile)
3. Include:
   - Detailed description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Affected versions

### What to Expect

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is a personal AI-generated project. Expectations:

- ❌ **NO SLA** — Response time may be slow or nonexistent
- ❌ **NO bug bounty** — This is not a funded project
- ❌ **NO guaranteed fix** — May not be addressed
- ❌ **NO professional security response** — Maintainer is not a security expert

**If security matters to you, use the original [Moltbot](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot) or hire professionals.**

## Known Limitations

### AI-Generated Code Risks

- ⚠️ Logic errors in security implementations
- ⚠️ Misconfigured sandboxes or permissions
- ⚠️ Bypassed encryption or authentication
- ⚠️ Race conditions or timing attacks
- ⚠️ Hidden injection vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ Improper error handling

### No Professional Audit

- ❌ No penetration testing performed
- ❌ No code review by security professionals
- ❌ No compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- ❌ No third-party security assessment

- Audit logging
- OAuth token management

**⚠️ REMINDER:** All features are AI-generated and unverified.

## Security Best Practices

### If You Use ClancyBot:

1. ✅ **Review the code yourself** — Don't trust AI blindly
2. ✅ **Test in isolated environments** — Never deploy directly to production
3. ✅ **Monitor everything** — Watch for unusual behavior
4. ✅ **Have backups** — Expect data loss
5. ✅ **Use strong authentication** — Don't expose the gateway publicly
6. ✅ **Keep Docker updated** — Sandbox requires current Docker
7. ✅ **Limit permissions** — Run with minimal privileges
8. ✅ **Audit regularly** — Use `clancybot security audit`

### Production Use (NOT RECOMMENDED)

If you ignore warnings and deploy to production anyway:

- ⚠️ Perform a professional security audit
- ⚠️ Implement additional monitoring
- ⚠️ Have incident response procedures
- ⚠️ Maintain backups and disaster recovery
- ⚠️ Consult legal counsel for compliance
- ⚠️ Accept 100% of the risk

---

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

**Expected timeline (best-effort, no guarantees):**

1. **Day 0:** Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-7:** Acknowledgment (maybe)
3. **Day 7-30:** Investigation (if time permits)
4. **Day 30+:** Fix released (if feasible)

**Reality:** May take longer or never be fixed. This is a hobby project.
